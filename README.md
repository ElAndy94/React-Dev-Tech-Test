## Hello There

Clone the repo and install dependencies in order to have a go at this unless you rather use the hosted version.

### Features 

The searching works fine with capital and non capital searches.

Validation could have been worked better and there is space for improvement, but due to lack of time I have given a short demo of what could be done but yes it does work as can be seen if button is pressed.

The form data does not submit into the array of jobs because it has not been connected, but it does validation and then if valid it would have then triggered the necessary steps. Due to this I created a function which you will find which creates a random set of jobs which I found pretty interesting.

Responsiveness was not worked on and the design was not kept too much as the code was online and there would have just been a lot of copy pasting of values, instead I put most my efforts towards the logic of the system.

Hopefully you like what I have come up with from scratch and enjoyed seeing the new hooks coming into play! 

### Things I would have done with more time?

I would have worked on responsiveness.

Hooked up the submit form with the jobs array.

Redux would have been implemented but due to the scale of the application it was best to leave it nice and simple.

Pagination would be something really nice to add esspecially when the function created over 15 different random jobs, but I cut it down to 5 - 10 random jobs to keep it clean.

Lastly I would have refactered some code and made sure to have type checked.
